I wonder if the idea in [Escape the heat](https://github.com/SupraSummus/shooting-range/blob/master/escape_the_heat/README.md) can be generalised? Or approaching it from the other side, if valuating everything with a scalar, single number price as we do currently is powerful enough to support complex economic and social systems.

We could have a "vector money" in which we would have a multiple number values describing a price. We could design components that reflect quantities we care about. For examplewe could have a dimension of "suffering involved" which describes how much a non-vegan this thing is. A cow killed increases the value by 1, chicken killed by 0.05 or something like this. Of course we must have a well-defined measure for suffering, but this is a different story.

We could have a component for environmental cost, entropy delta involved in production.

The main benefit of a system like this is that it could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the true 'cost' of a product or service. This could potentially motivate consumers to make more ethical or sustainable choices, as they would be more aware of the broader impacts of their purchases.
